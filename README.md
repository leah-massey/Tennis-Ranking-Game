# Tennis-Ranking-Game  ðŸŽ¾

A game where a user must successfully guess the rank of all top 20 female tennis players.



When the user makes a correct guess, the next top 20 player is (randomly) generated. This continues until all 20 players have been correctly guessed. 

A player has 10 chances to guess the ranking of each tennis player, if they fail to succeed in this time, the game ends prematurely. 

Players are generated one at a time but if a user is stuck, they can temporarily skip a player and return to them later.

Scoring 
A user can score a maximum of 10 points per player. With each additional guess they have to make, their point earning potential reduces by 1. 
The maximum score for a completed game is 200 (10 points for each of the 20 players). The minimum score for a completed game is 20 (1 point for each of the 20 players).
